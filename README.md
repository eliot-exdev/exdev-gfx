# exdev-gfx
Simple 2D/3D graphics engine for Linux (amd64, arm64), MorphOs (ppc), AmigaOs (68k) and MacOs (amd64, M1) written in C99.  
Currently MacOs support is not yet ready (but this will come in near future). 
This library is for private learning purposes only, but there could be some interesting stuff inside.  

# examples
There are two interesting examples which are using this graphics engine.  

## julia

## voxelspace
