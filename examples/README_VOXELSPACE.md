# About

This is a little technical demo of a voxelspace renderer written in C99.  
It was created for testing purposes and private research only.  
Currently I cannot say how it will develop in the future.

This demo provides five different worlds taken from the game Comanche developed by Novalogic.

- World 1: pyramid
- World 2: desert
- World 3: winter
- World 4: canyon
- World 5: rocky

You can select them by passing program arguments.

Have fun!

# Requirements

* MorphOs: any MorphOs system should work.  
  Tested it on a Mac Mini G4 Silent Upgrade with MorphOs 3.14.  
  You will need a 640x480x8 screen mode.
* AmigaOs: Tested on a Amiga 4000T, 060, Cybervision 64/3D, Aos 3.1.4 and  
                       Amiga 1200, 060, AGA, Aos 3.2.3.  
  It requires a stack size of 16384 or greater and a 320x240x8 screen mode.
* Linux: tested on Ubuntu 20.10 (amd64)
  It requires X11 server.

# Usage

Please start the binary (voxelspace_mos, voxelspace_060, voxelspace_060_c2p) from your shell.  
To get a complete arguments list of the program, please start it with '-h'.  
You can quit the program by hitting ESC.  
Stack size of 16384 ius required

On Amiga with gfx card, you should use voxelspace_060.  
On Amiga with aga only, you shpuld use voxelspace_060_c2p.  
This requires c2p.library from aminet (https://aminet.net/dev/misc/c2plib.lha).

## Program arguments
